How Do Python Coroutines Work?
==============================

Script for live-coding an implementation of Python async coroutines
analogous to asyncio.coroutine in the Python 3.4 standard library.

tornado.gen.coroutine is an earlier inspiration for the same idea.

The example program is a "web crawler" that fetches only two URLs.
Files are named in order.

10. The first version does a blocking fetch of the two URLs, one at a time.
20. Then it puts its sockets in non-blocking mode and uses an event loop and
    callbacks to connect asynchronously. Still fetches serially.
30. Add more callbacks to fetch asynchronously.
40. Add a "Future" to abstract callbacks.
50. Introduce "Task" and replace callbacks with generators. The combination
    of Task, Future, and generators is a coroutine implementation.
